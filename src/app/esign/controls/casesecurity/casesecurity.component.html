    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>We may request that you respond to an email to demonstrate you are able to receive these Communications.</p>
    <p><b>HOW TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT</b></p>
    <p>You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications under this Notice by writing to us at &quot;Attn: E-Sign Disclosure and Consent Notice, PO Box 6036, Englewood, CO USA 80155,&quot; or by contacting us via the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westernunion.com/">westernunion.com</a>.

    <p><b>REQUESTING PAPER COPIES OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</b></p>
    <p>You may request a paper copy of any Communications; we will mail you a copy via U.S. Mail.

    <p><b>UPDATING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION</b></p>
    <p><b>It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address current so that Western Union can communicate with you electronically</b>. You understand and agree that if Western Union sends you a Communication but you do not receive it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, Western Union will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you; however, we may deem your account inactive. You may not be able to transact using our Online Services until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.</p>
    <p>If you use a spam filter or similar software that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, we recommend that you add Western Union to your email address book so that you can receive Communications by e-mail.</p>
    <p>You can update your primary email address or other information by writing to us at &quot;Attn: E-Sign Disclosure and Consent Notice, PO Box 6036, Englewood, CO USA 80155,&quot; or by contacting us via the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westernunion.com/">westernunion.com</a>.</p>
    <p><b>FEDERAL LAW</b></p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that your consent to electronic Communications is being provided in connection with a transaction affecting interstate commerce that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and that you and we both intend that the Act apply to the fullest extent possible to validate our ability to conduct business with you by electronic means.</p>
    <p><b>TERMINATION/CHANGES</b></p>
    <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your Communications, or to terminate or change the terms and conditions on which we provide Communications. We will provide you with notice of any such termination or change as required by law.</p>
